In these circumstances, it was wholly inappropriate for the appellant to insist on the consideration of its miscellaneous petition for grant of in-principle approval. The Commission could not have gone for consideration as to whether a case of in-principle approval was made out or not unless and until the dispute over the issue concerning the change in law event has been resolved.

No. 7 of 2019wherein the said Commission has formulated a procedure for verification of status of Captive User(s) and Captive Generating Plant(s) (“CGP”) located in the State of Tamil Nadu, said to be in terms of directions of Hon’ble High Court of Madras in W.A. (MD) No. 930 of 2017.","Issue No.1:- Whether the appointment of TANGEDCO as the verifying as well as adjudicating authority is justified in law?Issue No.2:- Whether the documents to be provided for availing open access under Section 9 of the Act can be linked to Wheeling/ Open Access with captive verification?Issue No.3:- Whether it is correct on the part of Respondent Commission to treat SPV as an AOP for ascertaining the eligibility of captive status?Issue No.4:- Whether the State Commission is justified in implementation of the proposed Draft amendment to Electricity Rules, 2005 proposed by Ministry of Power which are yet to be approved and notified?",0,0,1,0,1,0,"We hold that the second Respondent/TANGEDCO can be entrusted with the exercise of collecting & verifying data for the purpose of verification of captive plant status only. However, any coercive action to be initiated against the CGP /captive users regarding its captive status or for recovery of CSS, as per law, it shall be decided by the first Respondent / State Commission.We hold that for the purpose of granting open access for captive purpose, the document as recorded at Para 11.3 shall be adequate/sufficient. Needless to mention that these documents, as specified therein, are within the framework of TNERC Grid Connectivity & Intra State Open Access Regulations, 2014 and also do not violate the provisions of Rule 3 of the Electricity Rules, 2005.We hold that as per provisions stipulated under the Rule 3 of the Electricity Rules, 2005, the SPV & AOP are two distinct entities and cannot be equated at par for computation of annual power consumption for determining the captive status.We hold that the verification for determining ownership & consumption for CGP /captive users under Rule 3, being an independent exercise, has to be done on annual basis, at the end of financial year.We hold that the directions contained in Paras 6.6.3 and 7.8.2 of the impugned order passed by the State Commission are in disregard to Rule 3 of the Electricity Rules and hence, cannot be sustained.We hold that as per settled principles of law, there cannot be retrospective application of the procedure formulated under the impugned order for verification of status of CGP/captive users. However, it is clarified that for the past years, the second Respondent/TANGEDO can verify data for the purpose of determination of captive plant status on the basis of data already furnished by CGP/Captive users while availing the open access.We set aside the directions contained in Para 7.6.9 of the impugned order wherein the State Commission has held that, in the event, the weightage average of shareholding of captive users changes within a financial year, then the same has to be intimated within ten days to the second respondent/TANGEDCO, otherwise the said licensee would proceed to verify captive status without considering weightage average shareholding.",,1,0,,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"TNERC Open Access Regulations, 2014; National Electricity Policy, 2005; National Tariff Policy, 2016; ",,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,0,0,1,0,"We have no doubt that Section 97 of the Act permits the appropriate Commission to delegate such of its powers and functions except the power to adjudicate disputes under Sections 79 & 86 and power to make Regulations under Sections 178 or 181. However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that it is a settled principle that any action undertaken by a quasi-judicial body, which includes delegation of power by the Commission to any authority, should not wither away the underlying foundation of transparency, unbiasedness and fair play. Vesting critical functions like verification of status of CGPs, captive users in the State of Tamil Nadu by the Commission upon an authority which can be a direct beneficiary of such process, cannot be said to be free and fair on the face of it.It is observed from the aforesaid that Rule 3 envisages two primary conditions for a captive generating plant to be fulfilled in terms of Section 9 of the Act. These conditions are firstly, that not less than 26% of ownership is to be held by the captive users and secondly, not less than 51% of the aggregate electricity generated in such plant determined on an annual basis, is consumed for the captive use. The rest of the Rule mandates what would be the manner of compliance qua a CGP established by a SPV, Association of persons and a cooperative society etc. What is material here is that the legislature in its wisdom has framed the process for determination of the status of CGP to be done annually, at the end of the financial year. It is equally important to point out that Rule 3 does not deal with grant of open access. The open access is governed by Sections 2(47), 9 and 42(2) of the Act. Therefore, verification of Rule 3 conditions qua shareholding, cannot be made mandatory pre-condition for grant of open access. Further, we also see that essentially between Rule 3(1)(a)(i) and Rule 3(1)(a)(ii) there is no exclusivity and the two conditions are dependent on each other. We agree with the submission of the Appellant that verification of the criteria mentioned under Rule 3(1)(a)(ii) cannot be done on a stand-alone basis, by ignoring Rule 3(1)(a)(i). Consumption of 51% of the aggregate electricity generated by Captive User(s), annually, can only be done by considering and verifying as to whether the captive users hold 26% of ownership.        From the above, we see that there is nothing contained in the TNERC Grid Connectivity and Intra-State Open Access Regulations, 2014, which mandates verification of shareholding structure of CGPs/captive users before/prior to grant of open access for captive use and we have to agree with the contentions of the Appellant. It is a settled position of law with regard to interpretation of statutes and regulations that a provision of law enacted under legislation of the Parliament or delegated legislation has to be read and interpreted in the manner they have been enacted. A quasi-judicial body or a State Instrumentality is not permitted under law to read into a legal provision                                              We accordingly hold that verification of minimum shareholding and minimum consumption on proportionate basis for CGPs and Captive Users has to be done strictly in terms of Rule 3 of the Rules, without any deviation and the said Rule envisages verification under Rule 3(1)(a)(i) and Rule 3(1)(a)(ii) to be at the end of financial year only. If the Distribution Licensee delays or denies open access, in a manner to defeat the concept of captive generation and consumption, then the question of verification under the above Rules will have no meaning and purpose. Accordingly, we observe that in such a scenario, Respondent No. 2 cannot benefit by its own default, and in the event, it is found that the open access was wrongfully denied or delayed, then Respondent No. 2 cannot seek to claim CSS at the end of financial year.We agree with the submission put forward by the Appellant that second proviso to Rule 3(1)(a) is a stand-alone provision and as such does not relate to Rule 3(1)(b). The Parliament in its wisdom has created an intelligible differentia under Rule 3, between a SPV and an AOP. It is clear from a reading of Rule 3 that second proviso to Rule 3(1)(a) which exclusively deals with an AOP, lays down that the captive user(s) shall hold not less than 26% ownership of the plant in aggregate and shall not consume less than 51% of the electricity generated, determined on an annual basis, in proportion to their ownership of the power plant.
On the other hand, Rule 3(1)(b) exclusively deals with a SPV, and it only provides that the conditions mentioned in Rule 3(1)(a)(i) and (ii) are applicable to a SPV, with the second proviso not mandated to be applied to it. Thus, we find force in the argument of the Appellant that second Proviso to Rule 3(1)(a) is a stand-alone provision.  In line with the approach adopted by us in the above judgment, wherein the previous judgment of this Tribunal holding that DPC is part of Non-Tariff Income, was declared by us as ‘per incuriam’, we proceed to apply the same principle in the present appeal. We opine that the decision of this Tribunal in Kadodara judgment (supra) is given without taking into consideration the provisions of Rule 3 of the Rules to the extent that Second Proviso to Rule 3(1)(a) being an exception under law could not have been applied to Rule 3(1)(b). The said decision was also given in ignorance of the judgments referred by the Appellant, namely B.N. Elias. (1936) I.L.R. 63 Cal. 538; CIT v. LaxmidasDevidas (1937) 39 BOM LR 910; and Dwaraknath Harishchandra Pitale, [1937] 5 ITR 716 (Bom), RamanlalBhailal Patel v. State of Gujarat, (2008) 5 SCC 449, CIT v. Buldana Distt. Main Cloth Importer Group, (1961) 1 SCR 181 and Mohd. Noorulla v. CIT, (1961) 3 SCR 515 which establish that an ‘association of persons’ is a recognized tax entity and not an incorporated entity. We cannot permit unreasonable hardship to be caused to a captive generating plant, set up by a special purpose vehicle, by applying the above judgment of this Tribunal in ignorance of vital facets governing the framework of Rule 3 and also important judicial decisions as noted above. In the light of this, we have no hesitation to hold that the decision of the Tribunal in Kadodara judgment (supra) to the extent it equates a SPV and an AOP is ‘per incuriam’. Consequently, the decisions referred to by the Respondents for the aforesaid issue do not lend any assistance. Therefore, the directions contained under 6.4.4, 6.4.5 and 7.6.4 of the impugned order are set aside. We have observed that the directions referred to in the foregoing paragraphs of the impugned order mandate verification of ownership and consumption for any change in the group captive structure for each corresponding period of such change. In the present Judgment, we have already held that any verification for determining ownership and consumption for CGPs and captive users under Rule 3 of the Rules, being an interdependent exercise, has to be done on an annual basis, at the end of financial year. In the scheme of Rule 3 of the Rules and in light of the decisions referred in Appeal No. 252 of 2014 and Appeal No. 316 of 2013, we have already settled this aspect that the requirement of 26% shareholding and 51% captive consumption are the minimum requirements to be fulfilled by a set of captive users, and once the same is done, the rest of the captive users not fulfilling the above conditions will have no impact to the overall captive structure. As such, we have no hesitation in holding that as per the aforesaid judgments, there cannot be any liability to make payment of CSS by defaulting captive users if the rest of the captive users fulfil the minimum requirements of 26% shareholding and 51% of consumption.We have noted the submissions of the Respondents and observe that while they are at liberty under law to take appropriate legal remedy, however the appeal before us emanates from the limited issue of challenge to formulation of procedure by TNERC for verification of status of CGPs and captive users in the State of Tamil Nadu. We also cannot lose sight of the crucial fact brought to our knowledge that what is being sought to be done vide the impugned order is an attempt to open the already concluded transactions by requiring additional documents, over and above the documents already furnished by CGPs and captive users who have availed open access in the past.applied. We agree with the submissions of the Appellant that the nature of shareholding in a captive structure is fluid and dynamic. That, existing captive users within the said captive structure can choose to give-up its ownership along with consumption of captive power at any point of time if it considers no usage for the same. In such a scenario, if no new captive user(s) is added then the shareholding along with consumption is accordingly adjusted. A CGP cannot foresee the future and predict as to how many of its shareholders may give up their ownership along with consumption of captive power, neither can it be predicted, if any new/ how many captive user(s) will be inducted within the structure.
In such a scenario, if in terms of Rule 3 of the Rules verification of minimum shareholding along with minimum consumption is not done annually, at the end of the financial year but done considering ownership at different periods during the year, then same would create unforeseen difficulties for a CGP to maintain its captive structure. As such, we opine that the verification mandated under the Rule 3 has to be done annually, by considering the shareholding existing at the end of the financial year. This is also evident from a perusal of Format-5 formulated by TNERC as a part of the impugned order, which also specifically contemplates verification to be done as per the shareholding existing at the end of the financial year. Similar view has already been taken by us in Appeal No. 02 and 179 of 2018 titled as “Prism Cement Limited v. MPERC & Ors” (supra).    We also note that the Act nowhere prescribes that a CGP once set up by an entity cannot be transferred to another owner or on transfer of ownership, the CGP loses its character of being captive despite fulfillment of all other conditions requiring it to be so, under Rule 3 of the Rules. A captive generating plant does not lose its character by transfer of the ownership or any part of the ownership provided, the generating plant produces power primarily for the use of its owner(s) and this can be done within the confines of a financial year.",,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0,NA,NA,NA,Respondents are producers using different sources of power.,RA,

As noted earlier, it is the statutory responsibility of the State Commission to frame Regulations in terms of Section 16 and 181 of the Electricity Act, 2003. The said clauses do not require petition to be moved by an interested party. There is no reason why there should have been a default in discharge of such responsibility particularly when the statute also speaks of “general” conditions and specifies certain time-lines on the subject [Proviso to Section 16 and fifth Proviso to Section 42(2)].

There is no reason why there should have been a default in discharge of such responsibility particularly when the statute also speaks of “general” conditions and specifies certain time-lines on the subject [Proviso to Section 16 and fifth Proviso to Section 42(2)].

The Respondent No. 1 has also contended that if the contentions of the Appellant are accepted then they will have to accept nine more similar claims. c) The State Commission failed to consider that the judgement of this Tribunal in Appeal No. 170 of 2012 is very much applicable in the instant case. The State Commission rejected it on wrong grounds stating that the coal based plants are different from the wind mill. d) The State Commission also failed to notice that vide letter dated 7.10.2011 the Appellant informed the Respondent No.1 that they can reach full load of capacity and can declare COD by 31.10.2011.
The Respondent No. 1 has also replied to this letter vide their letter dated 21.10.2011. Hence, the Respondent No. 1 was fully aware of the pumping of power in the grid by the Appellant. Accordingly, this Tribunal’s judgement in Appeal No. 170 of 2012 is applicable and the judgement of this Tribunal in Appeal No. 123 of 2010 is not applicable. e) The State Commission also failed to understand that there was no impact on safe and economic operation in the instant case. The State Commission also failed to categorise the claim of the
Appellant. The Appellant had requested the Respondent No. 1 to purchase the surplus power pumped into grid at infirm power rate which has been dealt in CGP Order of the State Commission. This order also specifies the infirm rate. The Appellant inadvertently interpreted the requirement of reaching full load capacity before declaration of COD which is actually applicable to SPV and IPP units and not on CGP’s. The Appellant could have declared COD at an earlier date without even pumping surplus power to the grid. f) The State Commission on various earlier occasions has held that the infirm power generated till COD has to be absorbed by the licensee and payment is to made under UI mechanism.

(iii) Whether the decision of the State Commission for re-classification of Private Research Institutes alone is in violation of principles of equality?",1,0,0,0,1,0,"

(a) Section 62(3) of the Act provides that the
Appropriate Commission may differentiate the
consumers on the basis of several factors including
the purpose for which the supply is required. The
benefit accrued out of the Government run Research
Units will be driven to public welfare and the profit
earning is a secondary one, whereas in private owned
Research Units, the profit earning is the prime object
and public cause is relegated to next level. Therefore,
the two can be classified as separate categories for
the purpose of tariff. Such classification is based on
an intelligible criteria and such classification has
nexus to the purpose sought to be achieved. The
Government run Units are not profit oriented and
purely service oriented. Thus, there is a clear
distinction between the Research Units recognized by
the Government and the Research Units which are
Government owned and Government affiliated.

(b) Section 61 (b) of the Electricity Act, 2003
stipulates that the Appropriate Commission while
making Regulations shall ensure that the affairs of thebdistribution licensee are conducted on commercial principles. A conjoint reading of Sections 61 (b) and
62 (3) of the Electricity Act, 2003 would make it clear
that the State Commission is empowered to make a
reasonable differentiation between Government
Laboratories and Private Laboratories.

(c) The impugned classification does not amount to
discrimination but amounts to preferential treatment
which is permissible under Section 62 (3) of the
Electricity Act, 2003.

(d) The above issue is already covered by the
Judgment dated 28.08.2012 in Appeal No. 39 of 2012
of this Tribunal holding that the different
classification between the Private entities and the
Government Institutes is permissible, in the light of
the wordings contained in Section 62 (3) of the
Electricity Act, 2003 that allows differentiation of
consumer tariff according to the purpose for which
supply is required.

36. In view of the above discussion and the findings, we find that
there is no merit in the Appeal. Consequently, the same is

We do not find any violation of public hearing

ii)

We direct the State Commission to true
up/provisionally true up the capitalization for
FY 2013-14 immediately and the short fall if
any should be accounted for while determining
Approval of Capital Expenditure without
approval of the Capital Investment Plan:
the tariff for the FY 2015-16, with carrying
cost on the impact of the variation on this
account in the ARR. We direct TANGEDCO to
submit the actual accounts of capital
expenditure and capitalization during
FY 2013-14 by 30.11.2014 to the State
Commission. TANGEDCO shall also submit the
application for Capital Investment Plan for
FY 2014-15 and 2015-16 in the requisite
formats to the State Commission by 30.11.2014
for approval as per the Tariff Regulations, if not
already done. The State Commission shall
approve the Capital Investment Plan of
TANGEDCO for the FY 2014-15 and 2015-16
after following due process of law, if not
already done, and consider the same while
approving the tariff for the FY 2015-16.

iii) Employees Cost:
We do not find any infirmity in the State
Commission considering the DA enhancement
in the employees expenses as this is required
to compensate the employees for inflation.
iv) Interest and Finance Charges:
This issue has been dealt with by this Tribunal
in Appeal no. 197 of 2013 and the findings will
squarely apply to the present case. We are,
therefore, not inclined to interfere with the
findings of the State Commission with regard
to interest and finance charges.
v)
We do not find any infirmity in the State
Commission not considering transmission
charges, taking into account demand charges
in the tariff and determination of average

billing rate in the impugned order. However,
there is error in determining the Weighted
Average Cost of power used for determination
of CSS as per the Tariff Policy formula. We find
that the State Commission has wrongly
considered the cost per unit in respect of
Mettur Thermal Power Station. We direct the
State Commission to determine Weighted
Average Cost of power for top 5% excluding
liquidity fuel and renewable average generation
and Cross Subsidy Surcharge as per the
directions given under paragraph 41 of the
judgment.

vi) Compliance of statutory advice of State
Commission:
We dispose this issue as per our observations
in paragraph 50 of this judgment.


vii) Peak hour and Non-peak hour Tariffs: This
issue is covered by the findings of this
Tribunal in Judgment in Appeal No. 257 of
2012. We set aside the findings of the State
Commission regarding rate for peak hours/off
peak hours and direct the State Commission to
re-determine the same as per the findings
given in paragraph 56 and 57 of this judgment.

viii)
The State Commission is directed to
determine the voltage wise cost of supply as
per our directions in this Judgment and
determine the cross subsidy transparently for
FY 2012-13 and 2013-14 and 2014-15 in the

Summary of Our Findings
In this case, the borrowings of the Appellant are more than the cost of the Capital Works due to mix-up between the Capital Account and Revenue Account. The Capital borrowings have been diverted for revenue expenditure. The State Commission has taken a practical view of the situation and allowed the entire interest cost and disallowed Return on Equity. We do not find any infirmity in the Order especially when the Appellant has neither provided any details nor has been able to establish that there has not been any diversion of fund.

(i) Whether the State Commission’s action in deciding the tariff of cogeneration plants in a suo-moto proceeding without circulating a consultative paper to the stakeholders as was done earlier before issuing previous tariff order in the years 2006 and 2009 is legal?
(ii) Whether the State Commission has given sufficient consideration to the ‘Promotional aspects as mandated by law’ and to give effect to the legislative policy of encouragement and promoting co-generation and generation of electricity from renewable source of energy ?
(iii) Whether the State Commission was justified in fixing the capital cost purportedly in accordance with the Central Commission’s Regulations and whether the determination of capital cost by the State Commission is in accordance with the law ?
(iv) Whether the State Commission was justified in determining the Fuel Cost of Bagasse on the basis of the cane procurement price instead of at the higher of the market price of the Bagasse or the equivalent heat value based on the cost of coal in accordance with approach of the Central Commission’s Regulations ?
(v) Whether the State Commission was correct in determining the normative Plant Load Factor at 55% declining the prayer of the Appellant to fix the PLF for an average of 5 years and under generation below 55% in any year should be allowed to be set off in any succeeding year in which the generation is over 55% ?
(vi) Whether the State Commission while conceding the need for an incentive has restricted this only to the extent of 10% of the fixed cost without fixing the appropriate incentive at a fixed cost of Rs.1/kWh in addition to variable cost for generation above 55% after setting off?
(vii) Whether the State Commission was justified in allowing the operation and maintenance expenses at 3% for co-generation plants established after 31.7.2012, when the Plants set-up before 31.7.2012 had been allowed substantially higher operation and maintenance expenses with annual escalation ?
(viii) Whether the State Commission was justified in allowing 1% rebate for payment within 30 days when the Working Capital and the interest thereon was allowed only for one months receivables and whether the State Commission ought to have allowed the said 1% rebate only when the Working Capital and the interest thereon was allowed for 2 months receivables?
(ix) Whether the State Commission has erred in supplying the charges determined under the head “Related issues” to the co-generation plants established prior to the date of impugned order including prior to 15.5.2006 when the Regulations of the State Commission specifically provided that such plants would be governed by their pre succeeding contracts unless they voluntarily chose to re-negotiate the terms and conditions of the supply to the Distribution Licensees by mutual agreements?

All the stake-holders had given their suggestions for either retaining or modifying the various norms decided in the earlier tariff order and the State Commission after giving them an opportunity of hearing and after considering their suggestions and objections on the various components of tariff has finally determined the tariff. However, regarding the some issues relating to the transmission and wheeling of energy from wind generators for captive use and third party sale, the State Commission has introduced new method for determination of charges as well as the mode for recovery of charges and revised the charges substantially, Hence, we feel that the State Commission should have circulated a Consultative Paper on these issues. All these issues have been specifically challenged by the Appellants in these Appeals. At this stage, when the State Commission has already given its findings and given its own reasons for the same, Circulation of a Consultative Paper by the State Commission and de-novo hearing of the case would not be necessary. However, after considering the submissions of the parties on some specific issues, we have given our findings and remanded the matter to the State Commission for reconsideration of those issues where we felt that the Appellants have to be heard by the State Commission.

ii) Applicability of Tariff order: The Tariff of the wind energy generators for procurement of energy by the distribution licensee would apply prospectively i.e. w.e.f. 1.8.2012 for the projects which are commissioned and entered into PPA on or after 1.8.2012. For wind energy generators who have entered into PPAs for sale of power to the distribution licensees prior to 1.8.2012, the then prevailing tariff would be applicable. However, the transmission and wheeling charges for wind energy wheeled for captive use or third party sale irrespective of date of wheeling agreement, the rate as decided in the impugned order will be applicable w.e.f. 1.8.2012.

…

v) Annual Maintenance Contract Charges and Insurance Charges: We direct the State Commission to allow the same O&M charges and insurance charges as a percentage of Capital Cost as decided in the previous tariff order dated 20.3.2009.

vi) Plant Load Factor/Capacity Utilisation Factor: We are not inclined to allow any reduction in Capacity Utilisation Factor on account of loss of generation due to grid problems. However, we have given directions to the State Commission, TANGEDCO and TANTRANSCO in paragraph 114 for augmentation of transmission and distribution system to avert loss of generation at Wind Energy Generators due to inadequate power evacuation infrastructure.

vii) Time Value of Money: This issue is decided in favour of the Appellants in terms of this Tribunal’s findings in judgement dated 18.12.2007 in Appeal No.205 and 235 of 2006.

…

ix)Abnormal Rise of Banking Charges: The findings of the State Commission on this issue are set aside. The State Commission is directed to reconsider the computation of the charges after hearing the stake-holdings and decide the issue afresh keeping in view the observations made by this Tribunal in Appeal No.98 of 2010.

…

xii) Deemed Demand Charges: We set aside the order of the State Commission and remand the matter to the State Commission for reconsideration after giving opportunity to all the persons concerned and in the light of the earlier tariff orders.

xiii) Encashment or lapsed Units by REC Captive users: The findings of the State Commission on this issue are set aside and the matter is remanded back to the State Commission with directions to hear all the parties concerned and decide the issue in the light of the judgment rendered by this Tribunal in Appeal No. 45 and 91 of 2012.",,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0,NA,NA,NA,,NA,(same tariff order for all 6 appeals - petition type unknown)

All the stake-holders had given their suggestions for either retaining or modifying the various norms decided in the earlier tariff order and the State Commission after giving them an opportunity of hearing and after considering their suggestions and objections on the various components of tariff has finally determined the tariff. However, regarding the some issues relating to the transmission and wheeling of energy from wind generators for captive use and third party sale, the State Commission has introduced new method for determination of charges as well as the mode for recovery of charges and revised the charges substantially, Hence, we feel that the State Commission should have circulated a Consultative Paper on these issues. All these issues have been specifically challenged by the Appellants in these Appeals. At this stage, when the State Commission has already given its findings and given its own reasons for the same, Circulation of a Consultative Paper by the State Commission and de-novo hearing of the case would not be necessary. However, after considering the submissions of the parties on some specific issues, we have given our findings and remanded the matter to the State Commission for reconsideration of those issues where we felt that the Appellants have to be heard by the State Commission.

ii) Applicability of Tariff order: The Tariff of the wind energy generators for procurement of energy by the distribution licensee would apply prospectively i.e. w.e.f. 1.8.2012 for the projects which are commissioned and entered into PPA on or after 1.8.2012. For wind energy generators who have entered into PPAs for sale of power to the distribution licensees prior to 1.8.2012, the then prevailing tariff would be applicable. However, the transmission and wheeling charges for wind energy wheeled for captive use or third party sale irrespective of date of wheeling agreement, the rate as decided in the impugned order will be applicable w.e.f. 1.8.2012.

v) Annual Maintenance Contract Charges and Insurance Charges: We direct the State Commission to allow the same O&M charges and insurance charges as a percentage of Capital Cost as decided in the previous tariff order dated 20.3.2009.

vi) Plant Load Factor/Capacity Utilisation Factor: We are not inclined to allow any reduction in Capacity Utilisation Factor on account of loss of generation due to grid problems. However, we have given directions to the State Commission, TANGEDCO and TANTRANSCO in paragraph 114 for augmentation of transmission and distribution system to avert loss of generation at Wind Energy Generators due to inadequate power evacuation infrastructure.

However, regarding the some issues relating to the transmission and wheeling of energy from wind generators for captive use and third party sale, the State Commission has introduced new method for determination of charges as well as the mode for recovery of charges and revised the charges substantially, Hence, we feel that the State Commission should have circulated a Consultative Paper on these issues. All these issues have been specifically challenged by the Appellants in these Appeals. At this stage, when the State Commission has already given its findings and given its own reasons for the same, Circulation of a Consultative Paper by the State Commission and de-novo hearing of the case would not be necessary. However, after considering the submissions of the parties on some specific issues, we have given our findings and remanded the matter to the State Commission for reconsideration of those issues where we felt that the Appellants have to be heard by the State Commission.

ii) Applicability of Tariff order: The Tariff of the wind energy generators for procurement of energy by the distribution licensee would apply prospectively i.e. w.e.f. 1.8.2012 for the projects which are commissioned and entered into PPA on or after 1.8.2012. For wind energy generators who have entered into PPAs for sale of power to the distribution licensees prior to 1.8.2012, the then prevailing tariff would be applicable. However, the transmission and wheeling charges for wind energy wheeled for captive use or third party sale irrespective of date of wheeling agreement, the rate as decided in the impugned order will be applicable w.e.f. 1.8.2012.

…

v) Annual Maintenance Contract Charges and Insurance Charges: We direct the State Commission to allow the same O&M charges and insurance charges as a percentage of Capital Cost as decided in the previous tariff order dated 20.3.2009.

vi) Plant Load Factor/Capacity Utilisation Factor: We are not inclined to allow any reduction in Capacity Utilisation Factor on account of loss of generation due to grid problems. However, we have given directions to the State Commission, TANGEDCO and TANTRANSCO in paragraph 114 for augmentation of transmission and distribution system to avert loss of generation at Wind Energy Generators due to inadequate power evacuation infrastructure.

While deciding these appeals to direct what is deemed necessary and proper for the parties to do, we request the Central Government to call upon the Central Electricity Authority to undertake the necessary study and recommend fair and equitable solutions balancing the competing interests bearing in mind the legislative scheme and public policy of the State such that all State Commissions are properly guided.
95. For the foregoing reasons, we find the impugned order, to the extent challenged, to be suffering from the vices of being shorn of reasons, arbitrary, capricious, unjust and inequitable. We, therefore, set aside and vacate the directions of the State Commission in the impugned order to the extent it stipulated (a) withdrawal of banking facility (i) for 12 months to Wind Power Projects commissioned after 31.03.2018 and (ii) altogether for all existing and new WEGs selling under third party open access sale scheme, irrespective of date of commissioning; (b) increase in banking charges from 12% to 14%: (c) increase in cross subsidy surcharge from 50% to 60%: (d) determination of the capacity utilisation factor at high level of 29.15%: (e) increase in open access charges from 40% of the normative charges for conventional sources of power to 50% of transmission and wheeling charges and the basis of levy on the installed capacity instead of generated units and imposing 100% scheduling and system operation charges for REC WEGs: (f) fixed feed-in-tariff at Rs.2.86 without accelerated depreciation (AD) and Rs.2.80 with AD without considering relevant parameters: and (g) reduction in liability for delay in Invoice payment on sale to Discoms category to 1% interest. In the result, the orders on the above subjects, as prevailing prior to impugned order, shall stand restored and revived for the control period covered by the impugned order. The State Commission shall ensure all necessary consequential orders are passed and these directions are scrupulously complied with by all concerned.
96. We would not allow further ad hoc approach on the subject. We, thus, also direct that the State Commission shall not bring about changes in the rules for power banking (of the kind attempted through the non-speaking impugned decision) by any further order without undertaking a study based on requisite data properly gathered and analysed so as to draw informed conclusions about financial impact on various stakeholders. We are given to understand that there is sufficient time available for such study before the time for issuing fresh order on the subject for the next control period arrives.

(b) Whether the amended PPA dated 25.8.2004 consequent to the change in Fuel, change in location and change in technology, was required to be amended and consequently required to be approved by the State Commission to ensure fair and justifiable operating terms and conditions including the payment of tariff therefor to the Generator?",1,99,99,99,99,99,"38.

i) The Appellant is not entitled to payment of full fixed charges and actual variable charges in respect of supply of energy between 1.7.006 to 15.6.2009 when the operational parameters were affected on account of shortage supply of gas by M/s GAIL in view of non availability of any provision in this regard in the PPA or Tariff Regulations.

ii) There is no infirmity in the findings of the State Commission in not agreeing to interfere with the provisions of the PPA or declaring the PPA unworkable with regard to compensation for fixed and variable charges for the above period due to shortage of supply of gas.

Hence, the Appeals are partly allowed.

The impugned order dated 28.03.2016 in Order No.2 of 2016 passed by Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission is hereby set aside to the extent of our findings under Para No.16, stated supra. The State Commission shall pass the consequential order within three months from the date of the present Judgment & Order as per the directions given above.

No order as to costs.",,1,0,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"CERC Tariff Regulations, 2012, TNERC Power Procurement Regulations, 2008, Power Procurement from New and Renewable Sources of Energy Regulations, 2008",,99,99,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,1,0,"Based on our consideration and analysis in the foregoing paras, we summarise our findings as under:-
i) Capital Cost:
We conclude that the Impugned Order does not fulfill the legal principles of providing adequate reasoning nor does it adhere to the TNERC regulations itself, which explicitly includes the principles and methodologies specified by CERC and the Tariff Policy of the Government of India, under which the Impugned Order has been passed. Accordingly, we direct TNERC to follow the CERC’s final order on benchmark Capital Cost for discovering the fair tariff.
ii) Evacuation Cost: In line with the principles / methodology adopted by CERC and various SERCs, TNERC should consider compensation for evacuation (inter-face line cost) from the pooling sub-station at the generator’s end, upto the grid sub-station, over and above the benchmark Capital Cost as considered by CERC.
iii) Depreciation
The State Commission has erroneously depreciated the value of the plant and machinery by adopting straight line method. It is against accepted and settled regulatory, economic and financial principles as it reduces cash flows in the initial term making debt servicing more onerous, the financial consequences of which have been enumerated above. We, therefore direct the State Commission to re-compute depreciation by following methodologies and principles prescribed and followed by all other state electricity regulatory commissions and CERC i.e. differential depreciation approach. We further direct the State Commission to ensure that aggregate depreciation provided is not less than the 90% of capital cost.
iv) Spares
Maintenance spares are an essential component for the efficient and continued operations of a solar generation plant, and the need for such spares cannot be dispensed with, especially without providing any cogent reasons and/or analyses that the same has been compensated in some other manner. We direct TNERC to re compute the tariff by factoring costs for maintenance spares while calculating the working capital, by following the principles and methodology adopted by CERC in this regard.
v) Degradation of Modules We direct the State Commission that the tariff determination must specifically factor for module degradation and reduction of generation
while calculating the levelized tariff.
vi) Auxiliary Consumption
We hold that the TNERC has considered the Auxiliary Consumption in strict resonance with CERC principles and hence, no interference.

vii) Return on Equity
We observe that the calculation of the levelized tariff in Appendix IA even on demurrer basis and assuming all the assumptions made by TNERC on generation, tariff and debt repayment, do not deliver the entitled RoE of pre tax 20%. We are also in agreement with the Appellants that by applying the actual cash flows over the life of the project, calculated on the basis of the generation assumed in Appendix IA at the tariff determined in the Impugned Order, in fact delivers a RoE much lower than the envisaged pre tax 20%. Therefore, we direct TNERC to re determine the tariff to ensure that the levelized tariff ensures recovery of the revenues permissible to the
developers during the life cycle of the plant at the energy sent out with degradation. The permissible revenues mean, inter alia, revenues that will deliver a pre tax RoE of 20% to the developers.
viii) Miscellaneous / (CUF, Discount Factor, O&M Expenses) Issues We find that the TNERC has rightly exercised discretion on these issues and we do not find any infirmity in the impugned order. Hence, interference of the Tribunal on the same is not called for.",,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0,NA,NA,NA,,SMT,"(both appeals from same suo moto tariff order, petition type unkown)"

17. Summary of our findings:

i) We find that the State Commission has followed the procedure for determination of tariff as laid down under Section 64 of the 2003 Electricity Act and the Regulations and we do not find any reason to set aside the impugned order only because the clarifications furnished by the licensee on the queries raised by the Commission public domain. However, in order to avoid any controversy in future in maintaining complete transparency and tariff determination process, the State Commission may consider to review and amend its Regulations so as to put any information furnished by the licensee or generating company to the State Commission subsequent to filing tariff petition on its website.

ii) We notice that the demand charges are imposed on the basis of maximum demand actually recorded or 90% of the demand quota fixed during the period of restriction and control. We do not
find any Regulations which provide for reduction of Demand charges due to load shedding or unscheduled interruption in power supply for some period. We do not find any illegality in the impugned order.

iii) We do not find any adequate justification in the proposal of the Appellant for creating a separate tariff category for textile industry. However, we give liberty to put up a detailed proposal to create separate category for textile industry with full justification during the public consultation process in future tariff proceedings and the State Commission shall consider the same and pass a reasoned order as per law.

iv) We do not find any infirmity in the State Commission determining a tariff higher than that proposed by the distribution licensee in its proposal in the petition filed before the State Commission.

v) We notice that the State Commission has increased tariff of the subsidized categories considerably. The tariff of LT domestic consumer has been increased by 40% and that of agricultural consumer by 593%. The average tariff of the subsidized category has bee increased by about 73% which is quite substantial. In order to keep the tariff of the Appellant’s category alone within +20% of the average cost of supply it might require increase in tariff of subsidized LT consumer by about 110% of the pre-revised tariff causing greater shock to them. If other subsidizing consumers have to be brought within +20% of the average cost of supply, the required increase in tariff in the subsidized categories would have been much higher. The comparison of change in cross subsidy with the previous tariff order for FY2010-11 where the large revenue gap was left uncovered in the tariff would not give a correct picture. Accordingly, we are not inclined to interfere in the tariff determined by the State Commission. However, the State Commission is directed to determine the voltage-wise cost of supply and corresponding cross subsidy for each category of consumers in the next tariff order.

vi) The aim of providing differential tariff for peak and off-peak hours is to shift load from peak to off-peak hours with a view to optimize the generation capacity and minimize the cost of power procurement for the distribution licensee. However, in the absence of a specific study on pricing of electricity for different time blocks the weighted average energy rate for peak, off-peak and normal hours (other than peak and off-peak) should be equal to the average energy rate decided for a particular category of consumer. In the present case when no specific study for pricing of electricity has been carried out, the energy rate of tariff decided by the Commission for the Appellant’s category is lower than the weighted average rates of energy for peak, off-peak and normal hours. It is also to be considered whether in view to the Restriction and Control Measures and penal rates for withdrawal in excess of peak hours demand and energy quota, whether there is any purpose of having a differential tariff for peak and off-peak hours. We, therefore, direct the State Commission to reconsider and re-determine the differential price of electricity for peak and off-peak hours. Accordingly, the matter is remanded back to the State Commission.

vii) We do not find any infirmity in the order relating to amortization of estimated revenue gap during the FY 2011-12 and 2012-13.

viii) We do not find any merits in the contentions of the Appellant regarding subsidy relating to agriculture.

18. In view of above, the Appeal is party allowed to the extent that the matter regarding differential tariff for peak and off-peak hours is remanded to the State Commission with necessary directions to reconsider and re-determine the energy rates for peak and off-peak hours.
