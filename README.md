# APTEL dataset repo


## Context

TrustBridge has studied appeal orders at the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) where various state Electricity Regulatory Commissions (ERCs) are either appellants or respondents. These orders were studied by a qualified team of lawyers, and through the use of Large Language Models.

We are committed to releasing the datasets generated in these studies for public use, so that our findings maybe verified and tested, and so that others may conduct their own studies using this data.

Currently, this repository has the dataset generated from our study of appeal orders at the APTEL from 2013 onwards where the Tamil Nadu State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) was either an appellant or respondent. We will update this repository as we add datasets for more state ERCs.
